# Chrome Extension: PR Changes with GPT

PR Changes with GPT is a Chrome extension that helps developers quickly summarize and understand the changes in a pull request (PR) on GitHub. The extension uses the powerful language model GPT to analyze the changes and generate a brief summary that developers can quickly review.

## Installation

To install the extension, follow these steps:

Open the Chrome Web Store and search for "PR Changes with GPT" Click "Add to Chrome" Click "Add Extension" to confirm the installation Once the extension is installed, you'll see a new icon in your browser toolbar.

## Usage

To use the extension, navigate to a pull request on GitHub and click the extension icon in your browser toolbar. The extension will analyze the changes in the PR and generate a summary.

## The summary includes:

A list of the files changed in the PR A brief description of the changes made to each file A list of any new dependencies added to the project You can click on any of the file names in the summary to jump directly to that file in the GitHub interface.

## Limitations

It's important to note that GPT is a language model, not a code analysis tool. While the extension can provide a helpful summary of the changes in a PR, it is not a substitute for a thorough code review.

> Additionally, the extension currently only supports GitHub. Support for other version control platforms may be added in future versions.
